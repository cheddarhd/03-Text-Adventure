Project: 03-Text-Adventure
Peer's repository: https://github.com/cheddarhd/03-Text-adventure.git


What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned that you can assign multiple of the same verb in a json file and it will still be valid json.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
Their json file is much cleaner than mine

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Remove the duplicate verbs in your json file, make it more clear which directions the player can go, maybe by using a method to list them off
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
There are few comments throughout the main.py code, better commenting would help to make your code more clear and understandable
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
no
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes, however the license uses their github username instead of their actual name.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
The readme is pretty clear for the scope of this assignment, maybe some explanations of how they based their json and engine
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Your main.py is very clean and precise.
